 Airline Satisfaction Dashboard is a project that analyzes customer satisfaction data from the Airline Personal Satisfaction Dataset and presents it in an interactive Power BI dashboard. This project aims to help airline companies gain insights into passenger satisfaction and improve their services accordingly.

 ## Overview

 This project leverages the Airline Personal Satisfaction Dataset to provide a comprehensive overview of customer satisfaction within the airline industry. The dataset contains information about various aspects of the passenger experience, including in-flight services, seat comfort, and overall satisfaction. By visualizing this data in Power BI, we can identify trends and patterns that can inform decision-making and enhance passenger satisfaction.
